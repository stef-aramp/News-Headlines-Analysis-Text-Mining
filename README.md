Prepared by Rohit Kulkarni

My work on this is to analyze two columns (publish dates, headlines) as much as I can. Using plots and tables in order to exract useful information and insights. Some name entities recognition (NER),combining with wordclouds, are used to explore better the headlines. Finaly we will see if there are any similar headlines through years!


tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, sic-kit learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SpaCy, Regular Expressions, Wordcloud.
